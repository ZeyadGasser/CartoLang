# ✨ Introduction

We all have wonderful childhood memories of watching cartoons — how we loved them, followed every episode, and even tried to imitate our favorite characters. Those memories are still stuck in our minds, full of joy and imagination.

That’s where the idea of CartoLang came from — a programming language that lets you write code using your favorite cartoon characters and their iconic actions.

Each keyword in the language is inspired by a famous cartoon character or a move they do, making coding not only fun but also full of creativity.
